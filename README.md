## What's Help Desk?
Help Desk is a full-stack web application that allows users and staff to register/login, create, submit, edit, and delete tickets, as well as add/delete notes on issues. I designed a responsive user-friendly frontend using React and performed state management by using Redux with Redux Toolkit. I built RESTful API with Node.js & Express to perform CRUD operations on MongoDB database using Mongoose. Finally, I also implemented authentication from scratch using JWT and deployed this project to Heroku (check out the demo to watch it in action).

 - React
