## What's Help Desk?
Help Desk is a full-stack web application that allows users and staff to register/login, create, submit, edit, and delete tickets, as well as add/delete notes on issues. I designed a responsive user-friendly frontend using React and performed state management by using Redux with Redux Toolkit. I built RESTful API with Node.js & Express to perform CRUD operations on MongoDB database using Mongoose. Finally, I also implemented authentication from scratch using JWT and deployed this project to Heroku (check out the demo to watch it in action). 

## Built Using the Following Technologies:
This project is built using the MERN stack and more:
 - React
 - Node.js
 - Express.js
 - MongoDB
 - Mongoose
 - Redux / Redux Toolkit
 - Axios
 - JWT
 - bcrypt
 - Heroku

## Usage

Create a .env file, paste the following, and add your own MongoDB URI and JWT Secret:
```
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://youruri
JWT_SECRET = enter_your_JWT_secret
```
Install your back-end dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Install your front-end dependencies:
```
cd frontend
npm install
```
Run the application in development (both frontend & backend):
```
npm run dev
```
